## Notes

This is my first Android app. Having no prior experience on Android, I ended up spending more time setting up the enviroment and going through First app video tutorial suggested in http://courses.codepath.com/snippets/intro_to_android/prework. The instructions were very clear and helpful. I will continue to work on the optional features after the initial submission
